# Vimium Dark

A custom dark theme for the Vimium browser add-on that looks minimal and uses the system-ui font. A variation of gajzl's [vimium-dark-theme](https://github.com/gajzl/vimium-dark-theme).

Forked from [gajzl/vimium-dark-theme-2](https://github.com/gajzl/vimium-dark-theme-2) which was a fork of [sei40kr/vimium-theme](https://github.com/sei40kr/vimium-theme). For more custom themes, visit [Vimium's GitHub wiki](https://github.com/philc/vimium/wiki/Theme) on themes.
